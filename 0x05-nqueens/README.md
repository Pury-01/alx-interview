# 0x05. N Queens

## Description
The **N Queens** problem is a classic challenge in computer science and mathematics. The goal is to place `N` non-attacking queens on an `NÃ—N` chessboard. This project implements a solution using the **backtracking algorithm**.

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.4.3).
- Code adheres to **PEP 8 style** (version 1.7.x).
- The script is executable and the first line includes `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

## Usage
The program accepts a single command-line argument, `N`, representing the size of the chessboard (and the number of queens to place). 
- If the argument is missing or invalid, the program prints an error message and exits.

### Example:
```bash
$ ./0-nqueens.py N
